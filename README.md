Here is a professional README.md template for your project, follow# AMI-Based Apache Web Server Deployment on AWS EC2

This repository provides detailed instructions and resources for deploying an **Apache web server** on AWS EC2, customizing the setup, creating a reusable **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**, and launching new instances using the AMI for scalable web infrastructure[attached_file:1].

---

## Features

- **Custom VPC Setup:** Define a dedicated network for your instances with IPv4 CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16`[attached_file:1].
- **Internet Gateway & Public Subnet:** Enable public access for your EC2 instances with internet connectivity[attached_file:1].
- **Route Table Configuration:** Direct web traffic efficiently to your public subnet[attached_file:1].
- **Security Groups:** Restrict SSH (port 22) by IP and open HTTP (port 80) for public web access[attached_file:1].
- **Automated Apache Installation:** Install and enable Apache2 with simple commands post-launch[attached_file:1].
- **AMI Creation & Reuse:** Snapshot your configured instance to create AMIs for rapid scaling or disaster recovery[attached_file:1].

## Quick Start

1. **Create VPC & Network**  
   - Go to AWS VPC console  
   - Create new VPC with CIDR `10.0.0.0/16`  
   - Attach Internet Gateway  
   - Add Public Subnet (`10.0.1.0/24`), enable auto-assign public IP  
   - Create Route Table and add route for `0.0.0.0/0` via the IGW

2. **Configure Security Groups**  
   - Allow SSH (TCP/22) from your IP  
   - Allow HTTP (TCP/80) from all (0.0.0.0/0)

3. **Launch EC2 Instance**  
   - Select Ubuntu AMI and suitable instance type (e.g., t3.micro)  
   - Pick your public subnet and security group  
   - Use an SSH key pair for access

4. **Setup Apache**  
   - SSH into the instance  
   - Update packages:  
     ```
     sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```  
   - Install Apache:  
     ```
     sudo apt install -y apache2
     sudo systemctl enable --now apache2
     ```

5. **Create AMI**  
   - In EC2 Console, select the instance  
   - Actions → Image and templates → Create image

6. **Launch from AMI**  
   - Use your custom AMI to spin up pre-configured Apache servers quickly

## Usage Notes

- Browser: Open `http://<PUBLIC_IP>/` to see the Apache2 Ubuntu default page after deployment[attached_file:1].
- For automation, consider using an Infrastructure-as-Code tool (Terraform, AWS CloudFormation) to repeat these steps for larger deployments.
